# Nimbuk

⚠ This is barely even alpha, keep checking back though ♥ ⚠

Generate a static HTML book just by providing markdown files. Greatly inspired by [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook), Gitbook and [Javascript.info](https://javascript.info)

## Install

### Nim user
If you have the nimble package mananger installed, then you can run the following command:
```
nimble install nimbuk
```

*Other install methods coming soon*

## Use

To use, run `nimbuk build`.  At the moment, you will need the folder you run it in to contain `src/contents.md`
